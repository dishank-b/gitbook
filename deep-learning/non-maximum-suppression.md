# Non-Maximum Suppression

[**https://www.coursera.org/lecture/convolutional-neural-networks/non-max-suppression-dvrjH**](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/convolutional-neural-networks/non-max-suppression-dvrjH) **- this is enough to understand NMS.**

When multiple proposals may correspond to a single object, which renders all but one proposal to be false-positive. Non-maximum suppression (NMS) solves this problem by clustering proposals by spatial closeness measured with IoU and keeping only the most confident proposals among each cluster.

Two of NMS:&#x20;

* Greedy
* Optimal

### Optimal

### Hyper-parameters

**Score Threshold**

Any proposals with confidence less than the score threshold are rejected.

**Overlap Threshold**

Two proposals are considered to be in the same cluster when their IoU is larger than the overlap threshold
