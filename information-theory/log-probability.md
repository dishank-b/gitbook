> **Human**: How to interpret log probability? Can it be considered as a quantity of its own? What would be intuition behind understanding log probability as a concept of its own

> **ChatGPT said:**

Log probability is simply the logarithm of a probability. Instead of working with raw probabilities, we work with their logarithms, which makes certain calculations easier and more numerically stable.

#### **Interpretation of Log Probability**

* **Summing Instead of Multiplying**: Since probabilities multiply when dealing with sequences of independent events, taking the logarithm converts this into summation. This is especially useful in machine learning, where working with very small probabilities can lead to numerical underflow.
* **Scale-Invariance**: Log probabilities spread out values more evenly, making them easier to interpret in cases where raw probabilities are very small.
* **Comparative Measure**: A higher log probability means a higher actual probability, but in a different scale. The values are negative because log(x) for 0\<x<10 < x < 10\<x<1 is negative.

#### **Can Log Probability Be Considered as a Quantity of Its Own?**

Yes! Many machine learning models, especially language models, work with log probabilities directly rather than probabilities. When evaluating a model's performance, we often use metrics like **log-likelihood** or **cross-entropy**, which are based on log probabilities rather than raw probabilities.

#### **Intuition Behind Understanding Log Probability as a Concept of Its Own**

Imagine you are dealing with a language model predicting the next word. Instead of thinking about a tiny probability like 0.00001, you might think of it as log‚Å°(0.00001)=‚àí11.5\log(0.00001) = -11.5log(0.00001)=‚àí11.5, which is easier to compare meaningfully against another log probability, like log‚Å°(0.01)=‚àí4.6\log(0.01) = -4.6log(0.01)=‚àí4.6.

Would you like an example where using log probabilities simplifies calculations?

> **You said:**

yes, I would like that example.

#### **Example: Computing Probability vs. Log Probability in a Sequence**

Imagine you have a language model predicting the probability of a sentence:

> "The cat sat on the mat."

Suppose the model assigns the following probabilities to each word given the previous ones:

$$P("The")=0.2,P("cat"‚à£"The")=0.1,P("sat"‚à£"The cat")=0.05,...P(\text{"The"}) = 0.2, \quad P(\text{"cat"} \mid \text{"The"}) = 0.1, \quad P(\text{"sat"} \mid \text{"The cat"}) = 0.05, \quad \text{...}P("The")=0.2,P("cat"‚à£"The")=0.1,P("sat"‚à£"The cat")=0.05,...$$

**Using Regular Probabilities**

To compute the probability of the full sentence, we multiply:

$$P("The cat sat on the mat")=0.2√ó0.1√ó0.05√ó0.08√ó0.03√ó0.04=9.6√ó10‚àí7P(\text{"The cat sat on the mat"}) = 0.2 \times 0.1 \times 0.05 \times 0.08 \times 0.03 \times 0.04 = 9.6 \times 10^{-7}P("The cat sat on the mat")=0.2√ó0.1√ó0.05√ó0.08√ó0.03√ó0.04=9.6√ó10‚àí7$$

This is a **very** small number, which can cause numerical underflow when working with floating-point numbers.

**Using Log Probabilities**

Instead of multiplying, we take the log of each probability and sum:

$$log‚Å°P("The")=log‚Å°(0.2)=‚àí1.61\log P(\text{"The"}) = \log(0.2) = -1.61logP("The")=log(0.2)=‚àí1.61 log‚Å°P("cat"‚à£"The")=log‚Å°(0.1)=‚àí2.30\log P(\text{"cat"} \mid \text{"The"}) = \log(0.1) = -2.30logP("cat"‚à£"The")=log(0.1)=‚àí2.30 log‚Å°P("sat"‚à£"The cat")=log‚Å°(0.05)=‚àí2.99\log P(\text{"sat"} \mid \text{"The cat"}) = \log(0.05) = -2.99logP("sat"‚à£"The cat")=log(0.05)=‚àí2.99$$

Summing these:

$$log‚Å°P("The cat sat on the mat")=‚àí1.61+(‚àí2.30)+(‚àí2.99)+(‚àí2.52)+(‚àí3.50)+(‚àí3.22)=‚àí16.14\log P(\text{"The cat sat on the mat"}) = -1.61 + (-2.30) + (-2.99) + (-2.52) + (-3.50) + (-3.22) = -16.14logP("The cat sat on the mat")=‚àí1.61+(‚àí2.30)+(‚àí2.99)+(‚àí2.52)+(‚àí3.50)+(‚àí3.22)=‚àí16.14$$

**Why Log Probability is Useful?**

1. **Avoids Numerical Underflow**: Instead of multiplying tiny numbers, we sum manageable negative values.
2. **Faster Computation**: Addition is computationally cheaper than repeated multiplication.
3. **Easier Comparison**: Instead of comparing tiny probabilities, comparing log probabilities is more intuitive (e.g., -16.14 vs. -20 is clearer than 10‚àí710^{-7}10‚àí7 vs. 10‚àí910^{-9}10‚àí9).

Would you like a visualization or code example to solidify the intuition?

> **You said:**

Yes I would like visualization to make it more intuitive

> **ChatGPT said:**

Here's a simple visualization to show the difference between working with probabilities and log probabilities.

I'll generate:

1. A **plot of probabilities** showing how they shrink as we multiply them.
2. A **plot of log probabilities** showing how they remain manageable when summed instead.

Let‚Äôs generate the plots.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (181).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Here‚Äôs the visualization:

1. **Left Plot (Multiplication of Probabilities)**
   * The cumulative probability shrinks rapidly, making it hard to work with very small numbers.
   * The y-axis is in log scale because otherwise, the values would be too small to see clearly.
2. **Right Plot (Summation of Log Probabilities)**
   * Instead of shrinking, log probabilities accumulate in a linear way.
   * This makes them easier to compute, compare, and interpret.

This visualization highlights why log probabilities are preferred over raw probabilities in machine learning and NLP models. Let me know if you‚Äôd like a deeper breakdown! üöÄ ‚Äã‚Äã

> **You said:**

I would still want to have a better intuition of what log probability could denote as a quantity, instead of log probability being beneficial numerically. Like probability is chance of an event happening or belief about event happening, could log probability be also associated with any such real or pseudo quantity2/2

> **ChatGPT said:**

That‚Äôs a great question! You're asking if **log probability** can be understood as a meaningful quantity rather than just a numerical trick.

#### **Intuition: Log Probability as "Surprise" or "Information Content"**

Log probability is closely linked to **information theory**, where it represents the amount of **"surprise" or "unexpectedness"** of an event.

* **Low probability events are surprising.**
* **High probability events are expected.**
* The log of the probability quantifies that **surprise** in a linear way.

This concept is formalized as **Shannon Information Content**:

$$I(x)=‚àílog‚Å°P(x)$$

**Example: Rolling a Die üé≤**

* If you roll a fair 6-sided die, the probability of rolling any number (1-6) is **1/6**.
*   Using log base 2 (common in information theory):

    I(x)=‚àílog‚Å°2(1/6)‚âà2.58 bitsI(x) = -\log\_2(1/6) \approx 2.58 \text{ bits}I(x)=‚àílog2‚Äã(1/6)‚âà2.58 bits

    This means observing the result of a fair die roll gives **about 2.58 bits of surprise.**
*   If instead, you had a biased die where one side (say "6") comes up with probability **1/2**, then:

    I(6)=‚àílog‚Å°2(1/2)=1 bitI(6) = -\log\_2(1/2) = 1 \text{ bit}I(6)=‚àílog2‚Äã(1/2)=1 bit

    You‚Äôre **less surprised** because it happens frequently.

#### **Interpreting Log Probability as "Belief Update"**

In Bayesian reasoning, log probabilities relate to how much you should update your belief when new evidence appears.

If an event has **log probability = -5**, it's much less expected than an event with **log probability = -1**. This could correspond to a larger shift in our belief when it actually happens.

#### **Key Takeaway**

Log probability is like a **measure of surprise** or **unexpectedness** of an event. Instead of thinking about it as just a transformation of probability, you can interpret it as:

> **"How much information do I gain when this event happens?"**

Does this framing help? Would you like another example, maybe related to language modeling? üöÄ

> **You said:**

I would like to more about log probability as a belief update. Maybe with example or some maths

> **ChatGPT said:**

Great! Let‚Äôs dive into **log probability as a belief update**, using an example from **Bayesian inference**.

***

#### **Belief Update in Bayesian Terms**

In Bayesian reasoning, we update our beliefs when we receive new evidence. This is expressed by **Bayes‚Äô Theorem**:

$$P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) P(H)}{P(E)}$$

where:

* P(H)P(H)P(H) is our **prior belief** in hypothesis HHH (before seeing evidence).
* P(E‚à£H)P(E \mid H)P(E‚à£H) is the **likelihood** (how probable the evidence is given the hypothesis).
* P(E)P(E)P(E) is the **total probability** of the evidence occurring.
* P(H‚à£E)P(H \mid E)P(H‚à£E) is our **posterior belief** (updated belief after seeing evidence).

Now, let‚Äôs **take the log** of this equation.

***

#### **Log Probability Form: Additive Belief Update**

Taking the logarithm of both sides:

log‚Å°P(H‚à£E)=log‚Å°P(E‚à£H)+log‚Å°P(H)‚àílog‚Å°P(E)\log P(H \mid E) = \log P(E \mid H) + \log P(H) - \log P(E)logP(H‚à£E)=logP(E‚à£H)+logP(H)‚àílogP(E)

**What This Means**

* The **posterior log probability** is the sum of:
  1. The **prior log probability** log‚Å°P(H)\log P(H)logP(H)
  2. The **log-likelihood** log‚Å°P(E‚à£H)\log P(E \mid H)logP(E‚à£H) (how well the hypothesis explains the evidence)
  3. A normalization term ‚àílog‚Å°P(E)-\log P(E)‚àílogP(E) (which doesn‚Äôt depend on HHH)

Thus, **learning new evidence adds information in log-space rather than multiplying in probability-space**.

***

#### **Example: Diagnosing a Disease**

Imagine a doctor diagnosing a rare disease.

**Step 1: Prior Belief**

* Suppose the probability of having the disease before any test is very low: P(D)=0.001‚áílog‚Å°P(D)=log‚Å°(0.001)=‚àí6.91P(D) = 0.001 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \log P(D) = \log(0.001) = -6.91P(D)=0.001‚áílogP(D)=log(0.001)=‚àí6.91

**Step 2: New Evidence (Positive Test Result)**

*   The test is **90% accurate** if you have the disease:

    P(T‚à£D)=0.9‚áílog‚Å°P(T‚à£D)=log‚Å°(0.9)=‚àí0.105P(T \mid D) = 0.9 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \log P(T \mid D) = \log(0.9) = -0.105P(T‚à£D)=0.9‚áílogP(T‚à£D)=log(0.9)=‚àí0.105
*   The test also gives **false positives** (5% of healthy people test positive):

    P(T‚à£¬¨D)=0.05P(T \mid \neg D) = 0.05P(T‚à£¬¨D)=0.05
*   The total probability of a positive test (marginal likelihood):

    P(T)=P(T‚à£D)P(D)+P(T‚à£¬¨D)P(¬¨D)P(T) = P(T \mid D) P(D) + P(T \mid \neg D) P(\neg D)P(T)=P(T‚à£D)P(D)+P(T‚à£¬¨D)P(¬¨D)

    Plugging in numbers:

    P(T)=(0.9√ó0.001)+(0.05√ó0.999)=0.05085P(T) = (0.9 \times 0.001) + (0.05 \times 0.999) = 0.05085P(T)=(0.9√ó0.001)+(0.05√ó0.999)=0.05085

    Taking the log:

    log‚Å°P(T)=log‚Å°(0.05085)=‚àí2.98\log P(T) = \log(0.05085) = -2.98logP(T)=log(0.05085)=‚àí2.98

**Step 3: Updating Belief with Log Probabilities**

Now, applying our formula:

log‚Å°P(D‚à£T)=log‚Å°P(T‚à£D)+log‚Å°P(D)‚àílog‚Å°P(T)\log P(D \mid T) = \log P(T \mid D) + \log P(D) - \log P(T)logP(D‚à£T)=logP(T‚à£D)+logP(D)‚àílogP(T)

Substituting values:

log‚Å°P(D‚à£T)=(‚àí0.105)+(‚àí6.91)‚àí(‚àí2.98)\log P(D \mid T) = (-0.105) + (-6.91) - (-2.98)logP(D‚à£T)=(‚àí0.105)+(‚àí6.91)‚àí(‚àí2.98) log‚Å°P(D‚à£T)=‚àí4.03\log P(D \mid T) = -4.03logP(D‚à£T)=‚àí4.03

Converting back to probability:

P(D‚à£T)=e‚àí4.03‚âà0.018P(D \mid T) = e^{-4.03} \approx 0.018P(D‚à£T)=e‚àí4.03‚âà0.018

Even after a **positive test result**, the probability of having the disease only increases from **0.1% to 1.8%**.

***

#### **Key Takeaways**

1. **Log probability makes belief updates additive**
   * Instead of multiplying probabilities, we **add log probabilities** for each new piece of evidence.
2. **Prior + Evidence = Posterior in Log-Space**
   * We can think of log probability as a **"belief score"** that increases or decreases as we observe new data.
3. **Prevents Numerical Issues**
   * Bayesian inference often involves tiny probabilities; log-space helps avoid numerical underflow.

***

#### **Final Intuition: Log Probability as "Weight of Evidence"**

* If something is **unlikely**, it has a **very negative log probability** (strong disbelief).
* If something is **likely**, it has a **less negative log probability** (strong belief).
* Each new piece of evidence **adds or subtracts from that belief** in a **linear way**.

Would you like me to simulate this belief update with a plot? üöÄ
