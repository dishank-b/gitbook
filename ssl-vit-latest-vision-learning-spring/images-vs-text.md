# Images vs Text

One way of looking at text is that text is a compressed representation of an image. Or text is a very compressed representation of the world. For example, if you remove some information from an image i.e. some pixels, you lose only a little bit of information. But on the other hand, if you lose some words from a sentence, you lose more information. So, it's more harmful to lose information from already compressed information.&#x20;
