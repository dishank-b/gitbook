# Derivatives

## Directional Derivative

Before getting into directional derivatives, let's see how the partial derivatives, gradient and total derivative fall into together.&#x20;

For this, we consider a function $$f: \mathbf R^2 \rightarrow \mathbf R$$ , which is basically a scalar function we multivariate input.&#x20;

$$
f(x,y)
$$

### Partial Derivative

Partial derivative is change in function when changing only of the variable, keeping the other fixes, and assuming that the other variable is independed of the first

So we will have two partial derivatives for this - $$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$$

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}
$$
