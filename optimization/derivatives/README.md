## Directional Derivative

Before getting into directional derivatives, let's see how the partial derivatives, gradient and total derivative fall into together.&#x20;

For this, we consider a function $$f: \mathbf R^2 \rightarrow \mathbf R$$ , which is basically a scalar function we multivariate input.&#x20;

$$
f(x,y)
$$
