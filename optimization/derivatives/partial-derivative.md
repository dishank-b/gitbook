# Partial Derivative

### Partial Derivative

Partial derivative is change in function when changing only of the variable, keeping the other fixes, and assuming that the other variable is independed of the first

So we will have two partial derivatives for this - $$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$$

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}
$$
