# Levenberg–Marquardt

&#x20;The LMA interpolates between the [Gauss–Newton algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Newton\_algorithm) (GNA) and the method of [gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient\_descent). LMA can also be viewed as [Gauss–Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Newton) using a [trust region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust\_region) approach.
