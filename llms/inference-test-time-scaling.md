# Inference/Test Time Scaling

* How does performance improve with more compute during test-time?
  * In what ways can be use more compute during test-time?
    * Parallel output - running the models multiple times and then do majority voting of the solutions
    * Longer output - Longer chain of thoughts.&#x20;
    * Categorised as Sequential vs Parallel
