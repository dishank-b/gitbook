## Linear Subspace

* Element zero has to be part of the subspace
* Linear combination (multiplication by scalar, addition of two elements) of any two elements belonging to the subspace also needs to belong to the subspace.

## Spanning

To span a complete $$n$$dim space, we need atleast $$n$$ independent vectors of $$n$$ dimension. For example, to span complete $$\mathbb{R}^n$$, you need atleast $$n$$independent $$x$$st $$x \in \mathbb{R}^n$$.&#x20;

## Determining number of linear dependences&#x20;

Let's say you have K vectors each of $$x_i$$ $$\in \mathbb{R}^n$$, such that K > n. But you use maximum have n vectors to span the whole $$\mathbb{R}^n$$such that there are no linearly dependent vectors. Hence when you have K vectors, some of them have to be linearly dependent on others. Hence there will be exactly, K-n linear dependences among the K vectors.&#x20;

## Linear Combination are vectors!

Say you have three vectors, $$\vec{a},\vec{b},\vec{c}$$ st $$\vec{a}+\vec{b} +\vec{c}=\vec{0}$$, in this there is a linear combiantion. But that linear combination is actually a vector, $$\vec{0}$$vector. So you can treat each linear dependence equation as actually a vector.&#x20;

## Null space

Space of vectors, that will be a linear combination of&#x20;
