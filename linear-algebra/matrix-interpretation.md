# Matrix Interpretation

## Matrix is Linear Transformation

* Any matrix-vector product is essentially a linear transformation.&#x20;
* Any linear transformation can be seen as a change of basis as well.&#x20;
* So matrix multiplication is basically a linear transformation of a vector or change of basis.&#x20;

$$A^Tb$$ where $$A$$is a matrix and $$b$$is a vector, denotes the projection of $$b$$ on the columns space of $$A$$.
